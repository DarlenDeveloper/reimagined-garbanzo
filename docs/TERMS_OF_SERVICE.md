POP
Consumer Terms of Service
Effective Date: 3rd Feb 2026  |  Last Updated: 3rd Feb 2026


Welcome to POP! These Consumer Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the POP mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the "Platform"), operated by Tubayo (U) Ltd ("POP", "we", "us", or "our"). By creating an account or using our Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully.
If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.

1. About POP
POP is an e-commerce and retail marketplace platform that connects buyers ("you" or "Consumer") with stores and merchants ("Sellers") across Uganda. The Platform allows Consumers to:
    • Browse Seller posts, promotions, and product listings through a personalised feed.
    • Add products to a shopping cart and complete purchases.
    • Track orders in real time.
    • Receive deliveries via POP's network of verified independent delivery riders ("Riders").
    • Access AI-powered customer service support.

POP acts as a marketplace facilitator and payment intermediary. We are not the seller of goods listed on the Platform — each Seller is independently responsible for the products they list and fulfil.
2. Eligibility
To use the POP Platform as a Consumer, you must:
    • Be at least 18 years of age, or have the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
    • Be a legal resident or be physically present in Uganda or any other territory where POP operates.
    • Have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts.
    • Provide accurate, current, and complete registration information.

By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements above.
3. Account Registration & Security
To access certain features of the Platform, you must register for an account. When registering, you agree to:
    • Provide truthful and accurate information, including your full name, phone number, email address, and delivery address.
    • Keep your login credentials confidential and not share them with third parties.
    • Notify POP immediately if you suspect any unauthorised access to your account.
    • Be solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.

POP reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that provide false information, violate these Terms, or engage in fraudulent or abusive behaviour.
4. Placing Orders
4.1 Product Listings
Sellers are responsible for the accuracy of all product listings, including descriptions, images, pricing, and availability. POP does not guarantee that product listings are accurate, complete, or current. In the event of a discrepancy between a listed price and the actual price, POP will notify you before processing your order.
4.2 Order Process
When you place an order on the Platform, the following process applies:
    • You select products and add them to your cart.
    • You proceed to checkout and confirm your delivery address and payment method.
    • You submit your order and make payment through the Platform.
    • POP receives and processes your payment on behalf of the Seller.
    • The Seller receives your order notification and confirms or declines fulfilment.
    • Upon Seller confirmation, a verified Rider is assigned to collect and deliver your order.
    • Your order is delivered to the address provided at checkout.

An order is only deemed accepted once the Seller confirms it. POP reserves the right to cancel any order if payment cannot be verified, if the product is unavailable, or if there is reason to believe the order is fraudulent.
4.3 Platform Fee
A non-refundable platform fee of UGX 400 is charged on each successful order. This fee covers platform maintenance, order processing, and AI customer support services. The platform fee will be clearly displayed at checkout before you confirm your order.
5. Pricing & Payments
5.1 Pricing
All prices displayed on the Platform are in Uganda Shillings (UGX) and are inclusive of any applicable taxes unless otherwise stated. Prices are set by individual Sellers and may change at any time without notice. POP is not responsible for pricing errors made by Sellers.
5.2 Payment Processing
POP collects payments on behalf of Sellers through secure third-party payment processors. By completing a purchase, you authorise POP to charge your selected payment method for the total order amount, including:
    • The product price(s) as listed by the Seller.
    • The POP platform fee of UGX 400.
    • Any applicable delivery charges.

Payments are processed at the time of order placement. POP does not store your full payment card details on its servers.
5.3 Accepted Payment Methods
POP currently accepts the following payment methods: Mobile Money (MTN, Airtel), Visa/Mastercard debit and credit cards, and any other methods displayed on the Platform at the time of checkout. Accepted methods may change from time to time.
5.4 Commission & Disbursements
POP charges Sellers a commission on each completed order pursuant to a tiered commission structure agreed between POP and each Seller. Consumer payments are held by POP and disbursed to Sellers after successful order completion, less POP's commission. Rider compensation is paid separately by POP upon delivery confirmation.
6. Delivery
6.1 Rider Network
Deliveries are fulfilled by independent Riders verified and onboarded by POP through the POP Rider App. Riders are independent contractors and not employees of POP. POP facilitates the delivery request but does not control the Rider's manner of fulfilling the delivery.
6.2 Delivery Address
You are responsible for providing a complete and accurate delivery address at checkout. POP and the Seller will not be liable for undelivered or misdelivered orders due to an incorrect address provided by you. If you need to change your delivery address after placing an order, please contact POP customer support immediately, before the Rider is assigned.
6.3 Delivery Times
Estimated delivery times displayed on the Platform are indicative only. Actual delivery times may vary due to traffic, weather, Rider availability, Seller processing time, and other factors beyond POP's control. POP does not guarantee delivery within any specific timeframe.
6.4 Failed Deliveries
If a delivery attempt fails because you are unavailable or unreachable at the delivery address, POP and the Rider reserve the right to cancel the delivery. In such cases, refunds will be subject to the Refund Policy in Section 7 below.
7. Cancellations, Returns & Refunds
7.1 Order Cancellations
You may cancel an order at no cost before the Seller confirms it. Once an order is confirmed by the Seller and a Rider is assigned, cancellation may not be possible. To cancel an order, contact POP customer support immediately through the app or AI assistant.
7.2 Returns & Refunds
POP facilitates refund requests on behalf of Consumers in the following circumstances:
    • The product delivered is materially different from the product listed.
    • The product is damaged upon delivery (photographic evidence required within 24 hours of receipt).
    • The order was not delivered but marked as delivered.
    • The Seller confirms cancellation of the order after payment.

Refund requests must be submitted within 48 hours of the expected or actual delivery date via the Platform or customer support. POP reserves the right to investigate each refund request and may request supporting evidence. Approved refunds will be credited to your original payment method within 5 to 10 business days.
7.3 Non-Refundable Items
The platform fee of UGX 400 is non-refundable in all circumstances. Certain product categories may be marked as non-returnable by Sellers (e.g., perishable goods, personalised items). This will be disclosed in the product listing.
8. AI Customer Service
POP provides an AI-powered customer service assistant to help you with order queries, delivery tracking, account support, and general platform assistance. The AI assistant is available 24/7 within the app. While we endeavour to ensure the AI assistant provides accurate and helpful responses, it may not always be able to resolve complex issues. In such cases, your query may be escalated to a human POP support agent.
Conversations with the AI assistant may be recorded and used to improve our services, in accordance with our Privacy Policy. The AI assistant does not have authority to approve refunds, modify orders, or override POP's policies beyond the parameters it is designed to operate within.
9. Consumer Responsibilities
As a Consumer using the Platform, you agree to:
    • Use the Platform only for lawful personal, non-commercial purposes.
    • Not attempt to manipulate prices, circumvent fees, or defraud POP, Sellers, or Riders.
    • Not engage in abusive, threatening, or harassing conduct towards Sellers, Riders, or POP staff.
    • Not submit fraudulent or frivolous refund or dispute claims.
    • Not attempt to access, interfere with, or disrupt the Platform's underlying systems or infrastructure.
    • Not use the Platform to purchase or facilitate transactions in illegal, counterfeit, or prohibited goods.
    • Not impersonate another person or create multiple accounts to abuse promotions or circumvent restrictions.

Violation of these responsibilities may result in account suspension, permanent ban, and/or legal action.
10. Seller Conduct & POP's Role
POP is a marketplace platform and is not the seller or manufacturer of goods listed by Sellers. Sellers are responsible for ensuring their product listings are accurate, lawful, and compliant with all applicable Ugandan laws and regulations. POP does not endorse any Seller or guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of any product listed on the Platform.
POP reserves the right to remove listings, suspend Seller accounts, or take any other action it deems appropriate to maintain the integrity of the Platform, without prior notice.
11. Intellectual Property
All content on the POP Platform, including but not limited to the POP name, logo, app design, software, graphics, and text ("POP Content"), is owned by or licensed to Tubayo (U) Ltd and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to access and use the Platform for personal, non-commercial use. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of any POP Content without our prior written consent.
Sellers retain ownership of their own product content but grant POP a royalty-free licence to display such content on the Platform.
12. Privacy
Your use of the Platform is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. The Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal data. By using the Platform, you consent to the data practices described in our Privacy Policy.
POP complies with applicable Ugandan data protection laws, including the Data Protection and Privacy Act, 2019.
13. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:
    • POP provides the Platform on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, express or implied.
    • POP does not guarantee that the Platform will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure at all times.
    • POP shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Platform, including loss of data, revenue, or profits.
    • POP's total aggregate liability to you for any claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Platform shall not exceed the total amount paid by you on the Platform in the three (3) months preceding the claim.

Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability for fraud, death or personal injury caused by negligence, or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.
14. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tubayo (U) Ltd, its directors, employees, agents, and partners from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your use of the Platform; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any applicable law or third-party rights; or (d) any content you submit or actions you take on the Platform.
15. Modifications to the Platform and Terms
POP reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Platform at any time, with or without notice. We also reserve the right to update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will notify you via the app or the email address associated with your account.
Your continued use of the Platform after any changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Platform.
16. Termination
You may deactivate your account at any time by contacting POP customer support or using the account settings in the app. Upon deactivation, your access to the Platform will be revoked.
POP may suspend or terminate your account and access to the Platform at any time, with or without cause, including but not limited to violation of these Terms, fraudulent activity, or legal requirements. Upon termination, any outstanding orders may be fulfilled at POP's discretion.
Provisions that by their nature should survive termination — including Sections 11 (Intellectual Property), 13 (Limitation of Liability), 14 (Indemnification), and 18 (Governing Law) — shall survive.
17. Dispute Resolution
In the event of any dispute arising between you and POP relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through good-faith negotiation.
If the dispute cannot be resolved within 30 days of written notice, either party may refer the matter to mediation. If mediation fails, disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Uganda.
Nothing in this clause prevents POP from seeking urgent injunctive or other equitable relief in any competent court.
18. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Uganda. By using the Platform, you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ugandan courts for resolution of any dispute arising under or in connection with these Terms.
19. Miscellaneous
    • Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and POP with respect to your use of the Platform and supersede all prior agreements.
    • Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
    • No Waiver: POP's failure to enforce any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
    • Assignment: You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without POP's prior written consent. POP may assign its rights at any time.
    • Force Majeure: POP shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, network outages, government actions, or civil unrest.
